    <h1>Influencer Type and CSR Engagement: A Survey on Sustainability Messaging Effectiveness</h1>
    <p><strong>Introduction to the Virtual Brand: Patagobia</strong></p>
<p>In this study, you will be introduced to a fictional brand created for experimental purposes—<strong>Patagobia.</strong>
Patagobia is a brand dedicated to sustainable development, embracing the core philosophy of “not only making the best products, but also doing the least harm.” While striving for superior product quality, the brand also aims to minimize its environmental impact as much as possible.
Patagobia focuses on developing eco-friendly, durable, and high-quality products, and upholds the values of sustainability and social responsibility throughout every stage of design, production, and operation. The brand actively engages with its community and takes concrete action in response to global issues such as climate change and environmental protection.</p>

<p><strong>Patagobia CSR Campaign</strong></p>
<p><strong>Worn Wear – Refurbished Clothing Sales Program</strong></p>
<p>This campaign is built on the concept of <strong>repairing</strong>. Patagobia has hired more employees in its garment repair facilities, set up simple repair centers in regular retail stores, and uploaded instructional videos online, such as how to fix zippers, sew buttons, and other basic repair techniques. The brand then refurbishes and resells used clothing on its platform at more affordable prices, advocating for a sustainable mindset of repair and reuse.</p>
